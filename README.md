# Java-exercises

Theses exercises are a series of Java related tasks intended to help learn programming from the beginning, I will be submitting all the tasks I've got to do
in order to comply the formative degree (Web Application Development).

Expect messy stuff since I'm not uploading in a concrete order, neither I'm filtering between programs well done and written, and silly programs (might do in the future);
also everything is on spanish since its my native tongue and the language used in classroom, for other projects I might surely keep it to english only.

## How To Use These Exercises 

1. Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 
    * Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
2. Go to an exercise directory and open the project file in your Java IDE. You can either open the file directly on a text editor like Notepad++, or use something like  NetBeans.
3. Do not submit your solutions to this repo, as any PRs that do so will be closed without merging.
